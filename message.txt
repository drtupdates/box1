Hello! PLEASE READ ME!

This current update has fixed the TV Guide, and missing channels have been restored. The guide updates every time you press TV Guide. Remember that Filmon now charge, but I am able to provide a free Live TV service to my customers. I'd like to thank my exsiting customers for their contiuned support, and welcome my new customers. Please note that I will not charge for remote updates, and will only charge for a call out if I see fit. I hope you enjoy the service and remember, if you have a problem PLEASE let me know, otherwise I can't fix it :).
This is the last "experimental/new features" update, as Summer season starts. I will of course fix problems as and when they appear, so don't feel like I won't be updating the service, I will. This Notification should pop-up when a new update is available, OR you can open it again by clicking on Update info, on the bottom row.

Have a Great Summer! 
- Dan
