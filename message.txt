Welcome to DRTtv
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

Version 2.0 Launched! I have launched this early as it fixes a lot of niggles (I have spent 40+ hours on a new TV Guide Platform)

It is a very easy to use guide - I will put instructions on my website - http://drt-tv.com/help (soon)
This guide has a ton of new features - You can set reminders, have programs automatically play and more is coming soon.

Questions? Comments? Requests? Feedback - Contact Dan Whatsapp 633 429 537 -drt-tv.com
Remember that I also provide full Sky TV with over 230 channels for just 20â‚¬ a month!
